# Tune Sync

## By Cara Babin, Noa Sasover, and Tara Ramanathan
Tune Sync is a music sharing app which helps people connect, share, and find music so that they'll be able to make new friends and bond over music interests.

From the home screen users can sign in. After signing in, users can browse the feeds of other Tune Sync members by clicking on different profiles on the left side-bar. Clicking on a username opens the userâ€™s feed, showing their music interests, ie. a curated playlist of songs they added to their profile, their top artists, and albums they've been listening to recently.
